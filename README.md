Run the file in an IDE like Apache Netbeans with Java SE and JavaFX dependencies to let all code work properly.

	Use radial lists to set letter tone or mute notes, spinners to select octave and instruments, and the textfield to set the note length in miliseconds (1000 miliseconds = 1 second).

	Click buttons to add notes, undo notes, or playback all added notes.

	Have fun creating your own Java songs!
