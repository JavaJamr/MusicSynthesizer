Run the file in an IDE like Apache Netbeans with Java SE and JavaFX dependencies to let all code work properly.

	With this program, you can create basic songs with up to 3 voices (channels) at a time using Java elements!

 	Here's how to make your songs using the program:

		Use the three radial lists in the center to set letter tone or mute notes.
		
		Use the spinners to select octave and instruments by number. 
		
		Use the textfield at the top of the program's window to input the note length in miliseconds (1000 miliseconds = 1 second).

		Click buttons to add notes, undo notes, or playback all added notes. You'll know which one does what when you open up the program.

Have fun creating your own Java songs! We hope to hear some masterful songs from you all!
